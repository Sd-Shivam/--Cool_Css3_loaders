Delightful and performance-focused pure css loading animations.

### What is this?

[See the demo](https://sd-shivam.github.io/--Cool_Css3_loaders/)

A collection of loading animations written entirely in css.
Each animation is limited to a small subset of css properties in order
to avoid expensive painting and layout calculations.
Animations will help you to save time when creating your webpages! 
These responsive layouts are pure css and easy to customize including colors.

I've posted links below to some fantastic articles that go into this
in a lot more detail.
